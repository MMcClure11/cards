To Create a Project:
$ mix new name-of-project

In lib cards, automatically generated defMod Cards do end
most of elixir is based on Modules with collections of methods or functions

iex : works just like irb for ruby, runs the shell
-S mix compiles the project and we can reference it

Elixir has an implicit return, the last value in a function will automatically be returned.

To run your file in the elixir interactive shell: 
$ iex -S mix

The elixir shell does not automatically recompile:
$ recompile

To close the shell, ctrl + C twice
